# ICT1018 Assignment

This repository contains the source code for all the tasks which
had to be completed for the ICT1018 assignment. ICT1018 is a
compulsory unit at the University of Malta which has to be
taken by first year Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduates
during the second semester.

## Running Instructions

The minimum required version for `python` is `3.10.4`.

The `answers` directory contains the implementation of the
algorithms. The parent directory contains the test files.

There is a test file for every question. Every test files makes
use of the required algorithms from the `answers` directory.

To run the tests make sure you are using a terminal. Also make
sure that your current directory is the project directory.

Then for example run the test script for question 1.

```
python test_q1.py
```

**Note:** The Python 3 executable might be under a different
alias/name. You might need to write `python3` instead of
`python`. (This is done to make sure there are no conflicts
between Python 2 and Python 3.)
