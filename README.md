# ICS2210 Assignment

This repository contains the source code for all the tasks which
had to be completed for the ICS2210 assignment. ICS2210 is a
compulsory unit at the University of Malta which has to be taken
by third year Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduates
during the second semester.

## Running Instructions

The minimum required version for `python` is `3.11.8`.

The `ics2210` directory contains the implementation of the data
structures. The parent directory contains the test files.

There is a procedure script, `procedure.py`. The script tests
the data structures, implemented in the `ics2210` directory, as
specified in the Course Project Sheet.

To run the procedure script make sure you are using a terminal.
Also make sure that your current directory is the project
directory.

Then run the procedure script as follows:

```
python procedure.py
```

**Note:** The Python 3 executable might be under a different
alias/name. You might need to write `python3` instead of
`python`. (This is done to make sure there are no conflicts
between Python 2 and Python 3.)
